"""
Script to fill holes in a surface mesh, and save the cap mesh as a separate
vtp files. If the surface mesh to cap is called endo.vtp, the script will save 
the cap as endo_cap.vtp. 

Also, produces the capped surface mesh as endo_capped.vtp. This is useful to
check the geometry and normals of the cap.

USAGE:
    - modify set the full path to the surface mesh that you want to cap below,
    and run the script.
OR 
    - Run the script at the command line with the path to surface mesh that
    you want to cap
