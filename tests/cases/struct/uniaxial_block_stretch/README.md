This test case simulates uniaxial stretch on a slab of material. The reference solution contains the fiber stretch and fiber stretch rate fields that were obtained analytically. The fiber stretch is computed as $\small \lambda = 1 + \frac{\Delta u}{L_0}$ and the fiber stretch rate is given by $\small \frac{d \lambda}{dt} = \frac{1}{L_0}\frac{\Delta u}{\Delta T}$. Note that $L_0$ is the initial length, $\Delta u$ is the displacement, and $\Delta T$ is the time during which the deformation is applied. 

The plot below shows the analytical and computed fiber stretch.
