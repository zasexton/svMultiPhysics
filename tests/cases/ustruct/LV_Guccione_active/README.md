This test case simulates an idealized left ventricle (LV) with a Guccione material model
contracting due to time-dependent active stress, and subject to a time-dependent
pressure load on the endocardial surfaces. The problem set up can be found in
Problem 3 of (Land et al., 2015)[1]. The simulation result is shown in the animation below.
